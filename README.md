# Moondust Theme

Early on in my programming journey, syntax highlighting aided my understanding the coding. However, as I gained more experience, I found myself relying less on it. Eventually, I realized that the abundance of colors was very straining on my eyes and made it difficult to focus and concentrate.

## About

Moondust is crafted to reduce eye strain, allowing to truly focus on code. It challenges the conventional approach of highlighting keywords and typical structures. Instead of drawing excessive attention to them, Moondust brings business logic to the forefront. Avoiding a vibrant color palette further helps maintain the focus.

The color palette is centered around shades of gray and blue. These two colors provide five shades, each serving a unique purpose in syntax highlighting. The shade `c0` is dedicated to comments, subtly enhancing readability. `p0` is used to gently push keywords into the background, while `p1` brings the body text to the forefront. For string quotes, `s0` is used, and `s1` is reserved for the string body.

## Syntaxes

Moondust is developed for each syntax individually. Alongside each syntax, you will find a comprehensive example showcasing the syntax highlighting.

## Acknowledgments

In the [initial phase](https://github.com/primer/github-vscode-theme/discussions/341/), Moondust was primarily a modification of the [GitHub Theme](https://github.com/primer/github-vscode-theme/). I owe a great deal of gratitude to the Primer team for their work. 

A special shout-out goes to the entire community that focuses on creating minimalistic, two-color, monochrome themes, particularly [Monochrome](https://github.com/anotherglitchinthematrix/monochrome/). It was a delight for me to delve into your work, and it is heartening to realize that our aesthetic preferences align closely.
