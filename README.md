## About

Early on in my programming journey, syntax highlighting aided my understanding
the coding. However, as I gained more experience, I found myself relying less on
it. Eventually, I realized that the abundance of colors was very straining on my
eyes and made it difficult to focus and concentrate.

Moondust is crafted to reduce eye strain, allowing to focus on code. It
challenges the conventional approach of highlighting keywords and typical
structures. Instead of drawing excessive attention to them, this theme brings
business logic to the forefront.

For a more in-depth discussion on the issues associated with the conventional
approach to syntax highlighting, recommend reading the articles
[A case against syntax highlighting],
[Syntax highlighting is a waste of an information channel], and
[I am sorry, but everyone is getting syntax highlighting wrong].

Moondust is tailored for each syntax individually. At present, it supports
[Astro], [C], [CSS], [Dockerfile], [fish], [Go], [Go Module], [Go Sum], [HTML],
[INI], [JavaScript], [JSON], [JSON with Comments], [JSON Lines], [JSX], [Lua],
[Makefile], [PHP], [Python], [Ruby], [Rust], [Shell Script], [SQL], [Svelte],
[Swift], [TOML], [TypeScript], [TSX], [Vue], [YAML], and [Zig].

In the [initial phase], Moondust was primarily a modification of the
[GitHub Theme]. I owe a great deal of gratitude to the Primer team for their
work.

A special shout-out goes to the entire community that focuses on creating
minimalistic, two-color, monochrome themes, particularly [Monochrome]. It was a
delight for me to delve into your work, and it is heartening to realize that our
aesthetic preferences align closely.
